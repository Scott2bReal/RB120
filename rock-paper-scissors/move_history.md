## Brainstorm

- Maybe prompt user at the end of the round if they want to view move history?

  - display_move_history can overwrite the usual game screen

- Create history instance variable for player and computer, maybe reinstitute
  @player_type?
  
  - Store as an array???
  
- Maybe move history can be stored in RPSGame? Might be easier/better than
  storing players' histories individually... No, I think storing each player's
  history in their own object is better.

- Maybe make a new class `History`? I tried using instance variables and was
  repeating the word history a lot...
